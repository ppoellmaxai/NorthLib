/**
 UIView subclass drawing either a horizontal (default) or vertical dotted line
 
 A DottedLineView draws a horizontal or vertical line of dots. When drawing a horizontal
 line, the height of the frame defines the diameter of the dots, when drawing a vertical 
 line, the width defines the diameter. Between two dots is one diameter additional distance.
 The following attributes are available:
 
   * isHorizontal: whether to draw a horizontal (or vertical line, true by default) 
   * fillColor:    the color to fill the dots with (black)
   * strokeColor:  color of the stroked line (black)
   * lineWidth:    width of the stroked line (0)
